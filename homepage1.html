		<h3>The Way Forward</h3>
		 
		 <p>After a lot of thought about what my next step is going to be, I decided that
		 I wanted to re-invent myself. I have always been interested in technology, 
		 software, implementations of solutions and efficiency. I remember I had my first
		 email address back in 1995, I I could only check it while going to the 
		 specialized UNIX computer center of my university. I was amazed about speed of 
		 conversations and message delivery. At that time Altavista, Excite and Yahoo 
		 where the dominant force in web search. Now things have changed so rapidly and 
		 are in a continuous development. My son now is used to having any inquiry 
		 resolved by asking it to the phone.
		 </p>
		 <p>I'm really excited about what I'm going to learn at Galvanize. We will be able 
		 to not only understand what makes the web work, but also be a part of the 
		 development and growth of technology. At the end of the day, what we are doing is
		 only going to help us grow as a society, with better solutions in our hands and 
		 better communication.
		 </p>
		 <p>I hope what I learn in Galvanize is the start of a fruitful career. Knowledge
		 is not enough to succeed, though. You also have to have a good network that is 
		 supportive and help you progress.
		 </p>
		 <p>One year ago I had no idea this was going to be my path; life has many twists
		 and turns but I'm lucky to have found this one. I wish all my classmates the best 
		 and look forward to having the best learning experience!
