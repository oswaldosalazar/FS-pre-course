		<h2>Oswaldo Salazar's Home Page, Part 2</h2>
		<h3>The Way Forward</h3>

		 <p>After a lot of thought about what my next step is going to be, I decided that
		 I wanted to re-invent myself. I have always been interested in technology,
		 software, implementation of solutions and efficiency.
		 </p>
		 <p>I'm really excited about what I'm going to learn at Galvanize. We will be able
		 to not only understand what makes the web work, but also be a part of the
		 development and growth of technology. I hope what I learn in Galvanize is the start of a fruitful career. Knowledge is not enough to succeed, though. You also have to have a good network that is supportive and help you progress.
		 </p>
		 <p>Last year I had no idea this was going to be my path; life has many twists
		 and turns but I'm lucky to have found this one. I wish all my classmates the best
		 and look forward to having the best learning experience!
