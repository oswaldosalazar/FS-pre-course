		<h2>Oswaldo Salazar's Home Page</h2>
		
		<p>Welcome to my first website. I'm excited to study at Galvanize and to be
		 part of this community. Here you will find a bit of information about me, my
		 background and aspirations.</p>
		 
		 <h3>Background</h3>

		 <p>I'm originally from Ecuador, where I graduated as an electronic engineer in 
		 1996. The next year I was recruited by the O&G service company 
		 <a href="http://www.slb.com" target="_blank">Schlumberger</a>. 
		 While working for this company I had the chance to travel to a few places in the 
		 world and had the chance to live in Brazil and the US.
		 </p>
		 
		 <h3>My life and hobbies</h3>
		 
		 <p>I'm the father of a 9-year old boy. I love to spend time with him. He's very 
		 curious and smart. We like to talk about anything! We even discuss politics, 
		 since he is a Bernie supporter. </p>

		 <p>I am a very lucky guy! I have the best girlfriend in the world. She's very 
		 kind and supportive. She's a certified life coach. Hopefully, after this course 
		 I will be able to optimize her <a href="http://www.gougegoods.com" 
		 target="_blank">website</a> 
		 and build an app for her.</p>

		 <p>Karate is my favorite physical activity. I've been practicing Shotokan karate 
		 since 2009. I hold a 2nd kyu rank (2nd level brown belt). My son, my girlfriend 
		 and I practice karate at <a href="http://iskfcolorado.com" target="_blank">ISKF 
		 Colorado</a>. 
		 I highly recommend this activity. It's great for strength, focus and 
		 concentration.</p>
		 <p>Besides karate, I like to explore the mountains in the great state of 
		 Colorado and elsewhere.
		 I also like to travel and learn about other cultures. Since I was a kid, I've 
		 always had a great interest in music, so I like to attend live music shows of 
		 many music genres.</p>
